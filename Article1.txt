  Abstract
  Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), important members of the noncoding RNA family, have been recently
  revealed to play a role in the pathogenic progression of diseases, particularly in the malignant progression of
  cancer. With the application of high-throughput sequencing technology, a large number of circRNAs have been
  identified in tumor tissues, and some circRNAs have been demonstrated to act as oncogenes. In this study, we
  analyzed the circRNA expression profile in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and normal adjacent tissues by high-
  throughput sequencing. We focused on circRNA_0000392, a circRNA with significantly increased expression in
  CRCtissues, and further investigated its function in the progression of colorectal cancer.
  Methods: The expression profile of circRNAs in 6 pairs of CRC tissues and normal adjacent tissues was analyzed by
  RNA sequencing. We verified the identified differentially expressed circRNAs in additional samples by qRT-PCR and
  selected circRNA_0000392 to evaluate its associations with clinicopathological features. Then, we knocked down
  circRNA_0000392 in CRC cells and investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects using functional experiments. Dual
  luciferase and RNA pull-down assays were performed to further explore the downstream potential molecular
  mechanisms.
  Results: CircRNA_0000392 was significantly upregulated in CRC compared with normal adjacent tissues and cell
  lines. The expression level of circRNA_0000392 was positively correlated with the malignant progression of CRC.
  Functional studies revealed that reducing the expression of circRNA_0000392 could inhibit the proliferation and
  invasion of CRC both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circRNA_0000392 could act as a sponge of miR-193a-5p
  and regulate the expression of PIK3R3, affecting the activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway in CRC cells.
  Conclusions: CircRNA_0000392 functions as an oncogene through the miR-193a-5p/PIK3R3/Akt axis in CRC cells,
  suggesting that circRNA_0000392 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer and a
  predictive marker for CRC patients.
